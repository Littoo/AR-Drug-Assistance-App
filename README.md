# AR Medical Drug Assistance App

The AR Medical Drug Assistance system facilitates and manages the medication schedules by entering the related information needed for the prescription medicine, instructions, and goals as given by the doctor. The different elements of the user interface of the system are designed to be as simple as it can be understood by anyone. Using the 2D elements of the AR environment as an overlay for contents, the texts are clearly spotted and identified, and are readable. 3D elements helped in perceiving the right drug to be taken during the alarm of the reminder.
